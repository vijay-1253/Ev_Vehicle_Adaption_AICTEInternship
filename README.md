EV Adoption Forecasting

📘 Project Overview

This project aims to forecast the adoption trends of Electric Vehicles (EVs) using historical data and predictive modeling. Developed as part of the AICTE Edunet Foundation – Shell Internship, the notebook applies data science techniques such as data cleaning, feature engineering, visualization, and time series forecasting to analyze the growth pattern of EVs in India.

🎯 Objectives

 Analyze historical EV registration data.
 Explore key factors influencing EV adoption.
 Apply time series forecasting models to predict future EV adoption trends.
 Visualize insights to support policy and business decisions in the EV sector.

🧰 Tools & Technologies

 Programming Language: Python  
 Platform: Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook  
 Libraries Used:
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib, Seaborn
  - Scikit-learn
  - Statsmodels
  - Prophet (for time series forecasting)

📊 Methodology

1. Data Collection: Public datasets related to EV adoption were used.
2. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning missing values, formatting date-time fields, and generating new features.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis: Trend analysis, year-wise and category-wise visualizations.
4. Modeling: 
    ARIMA
    Facebook Prophet
    Linear Regression
5. Forecasting: Predicting EV adoption trends for the next few years.

 📈 Results

 The forecast indicates an exponential rise in EV adoption in the coming years.
 Policy support, charging infrastructure, and awareness are key accelerators.
 Model accuracy and performance were evaluated using MAPE and RMSE.
